# CSEDM_DataChallenge

The goal of the Data Challenge is to use previous students' programming process data to predict whether future students will succeed at a given programming task. The task is to build a model that can predict, given a student's performance up until a given problem, whether or not that student will succeed at their first attempt at that problem.

## Dataset
The dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/thomaswp/CSEDM2019-Data-Challenge).
